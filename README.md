# Dancing Dragon

This is a game about a dancing dragon that wants to eat letters. You cannot let them do it because it will hurt their stomach. 
You must help the dragon by pressing the corresponding keys before letters reach the dragon.
If you do not, the dragon will lose lanterns and you cannot go to the festival together.
